I will be evaluating my learning experience by writing every new thing I learn each day, this way I can always keep track of what's new.
What I learnt today was a review of what we already took in code 102 plus how to setup a project properly and add different things to it. In addition to learning parseInt, tolowercase, touppercase and switch function.
